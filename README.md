- Iâ€™m interested in everything around machine learning and deeply curious about this topic for more than 12 years. You name it I love it. Be it Classical ML, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, RecSys, LLMs, counterfactual ML. 
- ðŸŒ± In 2024-2025, I am teaching a rigourous Machine Learning course at [The Curious Curator](https://thecuriouscurator.in/course/ultimate-machine-learning-course/).
- ðŸ“« You can connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dksahuji/) or email me at dksahuji@gmail.com
- Outside of work, I love to play lawn tennis ðŸŽ¾, reading about ML, catching up with folks, learning about investing.
